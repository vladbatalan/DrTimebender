# Dr. TimeBender
Dr. TimeBender is a puzzle type game in which the main mechanic is teleporting into the past. This way, the old instancens of the main character can open various gates for the present one to proceed. Be wary though! There are many ways for the past selfs to get stuck and cause a **GRANDPA PARADOX**.
